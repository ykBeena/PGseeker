pgDetailHeader



if only 1 photo, carousel not working
height of profile cards changing due to change in no. of pgs


what after contactUs page??
sort filter is removed on applying new filter(bcz it is set on frontend, so refreshes after every new request) should it or not
self review on top
change loader
pgs in profile
api functions all same, make one helper function
inputs of price and occupancy still uncertain
store persisting even on restart
what to do for sharing -> 6,7,8...(in PGCard and PgDetailsPage)
bad validation in add pg form(for empty fields)
specific error msg on pgOwnerForm page
put loading as initial state of state variable of things like reviews, profile data
review on own pg should not be possible
sort by ratings
